<h1> About Our Company </h1>

<p> Our business provides the ultimate sugar experience - retailing edible nostalgia in a fun, unique and novel environment. Our customers range in age from 8 months to beyond 88 years, and have a zest for all things candy.

Our vision is to continue establishing The Sweet Spot as the retailer of choice for 'edible fun' while maintaining our uncompromising principles as we grow. Our mission is to have a market presence encompassing 20 retail stores across North America by 2015.  In 1992 The Sweet Spot began in Toronto as a street level open-air booth on trendy Queen Street West. Our founder outgrew that booth and moved to a nearby storefront in early 1995</p>
